# wordlist-rewriter
This script is a command line utility made to rewrite wordlists based on certain conditions. For example you can only allow numbers from a certain wordlist. Or maybe not allow them.
This script is usually intended for those who want to make wordlists with certain criterias from a wordlist that has lines which do not meet those criterias. it's intended for bruteforcing targeted wordlists. I don't know if you can use it for other things.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medanisjbara/wordlist-rewriter
sudo cp wordlist-rewriter/rewrite.py /usr/bin/rewrite
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rewrite
```

## Usage

type `rewrite -h` for help


## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Mainly because I would like to learn about why those changes should be made.
If there's something you didn't like or you have a suggestion. Please open an issue as it'll help making this command line utility better.(and maybe help it get a bit more popular. I had zero interactions since day one even tho I thought that what I did was cool).
